INTRODUCTION
=============

Here are the instructions for interacting with TPMS. 


REVIEWER PROFILES
=================

Your conference's reviewers need to have profiles on TPMS.

Reviewers can create profiles by first registering here: 
http://papermatching.cs.toronto.edu/webapp/profileBrowser/register/

Reviewers can login to the system here:
http://papermatching.cs.toronto.edu/webapp/profileBrowser/login/

Once logged in reviewers populate their profiles by uploading their papers
to it. 

Uploading papers is pretty straightforward but just in case here's a nice
video that details the step-by-step procedure (this was made by the MICCAI
2017 PC):

Alternatively conference organizers can populate reviewer profiles on
their behalf. Please contact the TPMS maintainers for help with this. 


DATA FOR TPMS
=============

Below I outline the three key pieces of information needed by TPMS to
obtain reviewer-paper matchings.

1) Reviewers. You provide TPMS with a list of reviewers. The reviewer list
should be in csv file in the following format (one reviewer per line):
Email,FirstName,LastName


2) Papers. Once the deadline has passed you package and provide TPMS
with all of the submissions, in pdf format. The simplest, given the
size of that file, is probably for me to download that package from
some server.

 - papers should be given a numeric ID and files should be named:
      paperID.pdf (e.g., paper134.pdf)

Given 1) and 2), I can provide you with affinity scores in some suitable
format (e.g., reviewer-paper-score triplets in a text file).  It should
then be straight forward for you to factor in conflicts of interests and
other desiderata to come up with assignments.


3) Conflicts of interest (COI). Once the paper deadline has passed you provide
TPMS with a list of COI in the following csv format:

paperID, reviewerEmail

e.g., 
15, lcharlin@gmail.com


4) Bids. If you do have bids we can also use them. You can simply transfer
them in another file (in csv format with email,paperID,score). One thing
is that bids are always pretty positively-biased. It would be useful to
get negative bids from all reviewers.

Assignments. We typically return reviewer-paper scores. We can also return
assignments if you provide us with conflicts of interest and reviewer
constraints. Reviewer constraints are: a) number of papers per reviewer
(min and max); and b) number of reviewers per paper (min and max).
